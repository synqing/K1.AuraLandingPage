    <section id="problem" class="section problem-beat">
      <p class="problem-text">
        Every "sound reactive" light you've bought promised to visualize your music. What you got
        was a $40 rainbow that blinks when it hears bass.
        <strong>K1 is what you thought you were buying in the first place.</strong>

      <p class="eyebrow">How It Works</p>
      <h2>What K1 Actually Does</h2>
      <p class="body-text">
        You press play. Within a single audio frame, the bar reacts—not just to loudness, but to the
        actual frequencies in your track. Bass swells from the center, highs shimmer at the edges,
        and the light looks like it's floating inside the glass instead of sitting on top.
      </p>
      <p class="body-text">
        Under the hood, a dual edge-lit light guide injects light from both sides into optical-grade
        acrylic while an ESP32-S3 runs 96-band analysis at 125 Hz to drive those internal waves. You
        never see individual diodes, just a continuous volume of light that makes your room look
        like your music sounds.
      </p>

    <!-- SLIDE 4: NOT ANOTHER RGB BAR -->
    <section id="differentiator" class="section">
      <p class="eyebrow">The Difference</p>
      <h2>Not Another RGB Bar</h2>
      <p class="body-text">
        Most "sound reactive" bars just flip between a handful of presets when they hear volume
        changes—rainbow chases, fake VU meters, everything slightly behind the beat.
      </p>
      <p class="subhead">K1 does what they don't:</p>
      <ul class="brutal-facts">
        <li><strong>Other bars react to volume. K1 reacts to music.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>They hear "loud." K1 hears 96 frequencies.</strong></li>
        <li>
          <strong
            >Single-digit-millisecond engine tick means light lands with the beat, not after
            it.</strong
          >
        </li>
        <li><strong>They ship 18 color modes. K1 ships a physics-inspired engine.</strong></li>
      </ul>
      <p class="body-text">
        And because it drives a light guide instead of bare LEDs, you never see "a strip of
        dots"—you see light suspended inside the panel, the kind that makes people ask,
        <em>"Where is that even coming from?"</em>
