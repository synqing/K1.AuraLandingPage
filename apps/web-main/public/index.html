        A dual-core, audio-reactive light bar built for both ambience and experimentation.
      </p>
      <p>
        K1-Lightwave is a dual edge-lit light bar with 320 addressable RGB LEDs—more than any
        consumer RGB device on the market. It sits behind your setup and turns sound into fluid,
        volumetric light. Built around a dual-core ESP32-S3 and a custom light-guide diffusion
        system, it ships with ambience presets ready to run and firmware open for hacking.

          <li>320 addressable RGB LEDs across dual edge-lit light-guide panels</li>

      <h2>Physics, Not Pixels.</h2>
      <p class="subhead">Fluid light, not flickering noise.</p>
      <p>
        Most RGB lights trigger pixels on and off. K1-Lightwave runs a 125 Hz physics-driven
        renderer, so kicks, snares, and melodies appear as continuous motion—light flowing through a
        volume, not a grid stuttering on your wall.

        <li>125 Hz render loop for ultra-smooth motion</li>

        From one bar on your desk to a global creator platform for audio-reactive light.

      <p>
        K1-Lightwave is Node One. PRISM.node is the platform we're building around it—tools for
        designing, sharing, and syncing light shows across hardware. The Founders' Edition proves
        the physics and recruits the first people who'll help shape what this becomes.
